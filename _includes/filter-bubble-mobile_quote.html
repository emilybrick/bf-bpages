        <p class="italic">
          “From my perspective, it’s very easy to take a few select facts out of context and paint a negative story, which is what happened here. The article made false implications about customer traction — the company had been expansive in who it worked sense and were aligned with its ethos and goals."

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         “Consulting companies can surely make a lot of money, but none to my knowledge have the kind of valuation that Palantir currently commands. If it turns out that every customer of Palantir’s requires a custom solution, then I think they’re likely overvalued, because that model scales poorly. On the other hand, if Palantir has genuinely figured out a way to ‘software-ize’ data analysis and to turn it into a commodity, then they are very likely undervalued.”
