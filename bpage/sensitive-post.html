      <p class="xs-mt3 xs-mb2">Three children — including a 3-month-old baby — and a man died in a multi-unit building fire in Chicago early Tuesday, police said. The arson unit is investigating the fire and detectives were questioning a person of interest, Chicago police confirmed to BuzzFeed News.</p>

      <p class="xs-mb2">The fire began at approximately 1:37 am local time in a South Chicago neighborhood. The 3-month-old baby was found next to a man who jumped from the three-story building, the Chicago Tribune reported.The infant was pronounced dead at a hospital, police said. Two other children, whose ages were unknown, were also found dead along with an unidentified man.</p>

      <p class="xs-mb2">A man suspected of starting the fire reportedly had an argument with someone in the building, a police source told the Tribune. He escaped the fire.</p>

      <p class="xs-mb2">A 48-year-old man was also taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries, police said.</p>

      <p class="xs-mb2">A witness, Clay Turner, told the Tribune that he saw the 3-month-old next to a man lying on the ground and screaming for help. Turner said he tried to help them.
      “I’m just speechless,” he said.</p>
